            For some days prior to last Wednesday
            the big bottle of <placeName ref="#CITY">Lithia</placeName>
            water accustomed to stand on his desk to the left of the president was missing.
            Members floated up and after trying the faucet and finding a drouth, went away.
            <persName> Brick Miller </persName> threatened to introduce a resolution to require
            <affiliation type="government"><persName>the secretary </persName></affiliation>
            to keep the necessary irrigating substance on hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thursday morning the bottle, filled to the bursting point with cool, limpid
            <placeName ref="#CITY">Lithia</placeName> aqua, invited the thirsty.
            By way of parenthesis it is stated that the 'cue to members was held Wednesday afternoon.
            And the crowd about the fount of coolness all during the session Thursday was about
            like a watermelon cutting in <placeName ref="#BLACK"> Darktown </placeName>.
            And <affiliation type="government">
              <persName> Secretary Northen </persName>
            </affiliation> smiled benignantly upon them, and now and then took a refreshing sip himself.
